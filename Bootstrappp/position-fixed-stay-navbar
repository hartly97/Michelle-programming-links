Use the .fixed-top class to make any element fixed/stay at the top of the page:


<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top">
  ...
</nav>

Use the .fixed-bottom class to make any element fixed/stay at the bottom of the page:

  ...
</nav>
Use the .sticky-top class to make any element fixed/stay at the top of the page when you scroll past it. Note: This class does not work in IE11 and earlier (will treat it as position:relative).

  ...
</nav>
