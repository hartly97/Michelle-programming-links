git branch --merged master : This prints the branches merged into master

git branch --merged lists : This prints the branches merged into HEAD (i.e. tip of current branch)

git branch --no-merged : This prints the branches that have not been merged

By default this applies only to local branches.

Use -a flag to show both local and remote branches.

Use -r flag to show only the remote branches.
