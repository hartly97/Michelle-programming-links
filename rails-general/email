Emails

    
Sending email is the most common task that can and should be done in the background job. 
There is no reason to send emails immediately (before the response is rendered), and I always move 
all emails to the queue. Even if the email server responds in 100ms, that’s still 100ms that you’re 
making your user wait when they don’t need to.

Sending emails via a background job is super simple with Active Job, mainly because it comes built-in to ActionMailer.

By changing the method deliver_now to deliver_later, Active Job will automatically send this email asynchronously in the queue.

UserMailer.welcome(@user).deliver_later
