Removing Active Storage Routes from Rails 5.2


In your config/application.rb file, find the line:

require 'rails/all'

And replace it with:

require "rails"

# Include each railties manually, excluding `active_storage/engine`
require "active_model/railtie"
require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
# require "active_storage/engine"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "action_view/railtie"
require "action_cable/engine"
require "sprockets/railtie"
require "rails/test_unit/railtie"

Undefined method `active_storage' error


NoMethodError: undefined method `active_storage' for #<Rails::Application::Configuration
You have a reference to ActiveStorage in one of your config/application.rb or config/environments/*.rb files which looks like:

# Store uploaded files on the local file system (see config/storage.yml for options)
config.active_storage.service = :local
Remove that line and also the config/storage.yml if it is present, and you should be good to go.

Skip adding ActiveStorage on new builds
If you're starting a new project and you'd like to skip having ActiveStorage be added from the get go, add the --skip-active-storage argument when you generate a new project. For example:

rails new AwesomeProject --skip-active-storage
